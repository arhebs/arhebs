# Hi, I'm Shalom 👋

**Backend engineer focused on building and operating cloud-native APIs, with growing skills in DevOps and AI-powered features.**

- 🔭 Currently building **ToggleCraft** – a feature flag platform for safe, progressive deployments (LaunchDarkly-lite).
- 🌩️ Interested in **cloud-native architectures, DevOps, and platform engineering**.
- 🤖 Learning to integrate **LLM/AI features** into backend systems in a practical, non-gimmicky way.
- 🌍 Open to backend roles in **Russia → Poland → EU/US/Australia** (remote or relocation).

---

## 🔧 Tech I work with

- **Languages:** Python (primary), TypeScript (familiar)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Django, REST APIs, background jobs
- **Data & Storage:** PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible object storage
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, AWS (ECS/RDS/S3), Terraform (learning)
- **Practices:** CI/CD, feature flags, safe rollouts, observability basics (logging, metrics, health checks)

## 🏗 Highlighted projects

> I’m actively building out a backend + DevOps + AI portfolio. Start with these:

### 🚩 ToggleCraft – Feature Flag Management Service

A cloud-native feature flag platform for safe, progressive deployments and controlled rollouts.

- Multi-tenant projects, environments, and flags
- Snapshot API for low-latency flag evaluation
- Admin control-plane REST API + Python CLI
- Dockerized local stack (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- CI pipeline with tests on every push

➡️ Repo: _coming soon_

### 💸 ExpenseEase AI – Smart Expense Tracker API

An AI-powered expense processing API that turns uploaded receipts into structured financial data using OCR + LLMs.

- File upload API for receipt images/PDFs
- Storage in S3 + structured records in PostgreSQL
- Background workers for async processing of receipts
- Integration with OpenAI / Textract-style services for extraction
- Designed with validation, error handling, and safe retries

➡️ Repo: _coming soon_

### 📡 SitePulse – Uptime Monitoring & Alerts

An uptime and alerting service that continuously probes URLs, stores results, and triggers alerts when services go down.

- API to register services and inspect check history
- Background workers to run scheduled health checks in parallel
- Alerting via email/webhooks on failures
- Metrics, logging, and health endpoints for observability
- Multi-container setup (API + worker) with Docker Compose

➡️ Repo: _coming soon_

## 🔭 Upcoming projects (roadmap)

These are planned follow-up projects that build on the same backend + DevOps + AI stack:

- **InsightHub AI** – Knowledge base Q&A service using embeddings, vector search, and LLMs for “ChatGPT over your documents”.
- **PullRequest Guru** – AI-powered GitHub code review bot that listens to webhooks and posts review comments on pull requests.
- **TelemetryHub** – IoT telemetry pipeline with stream processing, anomaly detection, and a scalable ingest/query architecture.

---

## 🧠 What I’m focusing on right now

- Designing **production-style architectures** for backend services, not just toy apps
- Getting comfortable with **AWS + Docker + Terraform** for realistic deployments
- Building a **feature-flag platform** I can use across my own projects
- Leveling up from early-career backend dev → **mid-level backend/platform engineer**
